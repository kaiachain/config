    "question": "How can I bridge to Kaia?",
    "answer": "You can transfer tokens from an external chain to the Kaia chain through the ‘Bridge’ tab on the portal. \n(Both Stargate and Wormhole bridges are supported.) \n\nPlease make sure to check which assets are supported by the liquidity pool of the DEX where you intend to provide liquidity! \n\nFor example, even though it’s the same USDC, ‘USDC sent through Stargate’ and ‘USDC sent through Wormhole’ are treated as different assets."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I earn points?",
    "answer": "You can earn points by participating in missions. \nPoints are calculated and accumulated every hour based on the level of your participation in the missions. \n\nThe more liquidity you provide to participating projects, the more points you can earn. \nIn particular, providing liquidity to pools with higher risks of impermanent loss, such as the KAIA/USDT pair on DEXs, you can earn more points.\n\n*Tip: You can earn points faster by applying the Boost effect. \nThe Boost effect is applied when you hold certain assets or meet various conditions."

  {
    "question": "What are the point rewards?",
    "answer": "By providing liquidity to the projects in the Portal Mission, you can receive Kaia points, points from participating projects, D2I program rewards, and DeFi protocol earnings as rewards. \nRegarding Kaia points, the rewards are distributed as follows:\n\nKaia Rewards: Up to 20 million KAIA will be rewarded to general participants based on milestones. \nUp to 30 million KAIA will be rewarded to wallets that participated in the FGP-23 vote in the existing Finschia ecosystem. \nThis reward pool is separate from the general participant pool and is exclusive to wallets that participated in the FGP-23 vote. \nUsers with long-term on-chain contributions in the Finschia ecosystem can receive up to 10 million KAIA in weighted rewards by participating in the Kaia Portal Mission, but they will not receive rewards if they do not participate.\n\n- An initial allocation of 20 million KAIA (10 million to general participants / 10 million to FGP-23 participants) is set aside.\n- If TVL reaches $100M, an additional 15 million KAIA (5 million KAIA to general participants / 10 million KAIA to FGP-23 participants) will be allocated.\n- If TVL reaches $150M, an additional 15 million KAIA (5 million KAIA to general participants / 10 million KAIA to FGP-23 participants) will be allocated.\n\nVesting: Tokens converted at the end of the campaign will be distributed over 6 months. \nWhen the campaign ends and users claim the point conversion (from Kaia points to KAIA tokens), the claimed KAIA tokens will have a 6-month vesting period."

    "question": "Where can I claim Kaia points after the Epoch ends?",
    "answer": "You can claim them by connecting your wallet through the ‘Claim’ menu under the ‘Mission’ tab."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a set period for claiming Kaia points?",
    "answer": "Yes. \nPlease be aware of the claimable period after the Epoch ends, and be sure to claim your points within that period. \nOnce the claim period has passed and a new Epoch begins, you will not be able to claim Kaia points accumulated from the previous Epoch."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I check and claim project points other than Kaia points?",
    "answer": "You will soon be able to check each project’s point policies via the updated link. \nProject points can be claimed on the respective project’s page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can Boosts be applied simultaneously?",
    "answer": "Yes. \nIf you are an early Portal participant (1.2x boost) and receive another 1.2x boost, they will stack, giving you a total boost of 1.44x (1.2 * 1.2)."
