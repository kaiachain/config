    "question": "What is an Epoch?",
    "answer": "An Epoch is a time-limited airdrop mission where participants can earn Kaia Tokens and Ecosystem Tokens by engaging in Kaia’s on-chain activities. The primary goal of an Epoch is to enhance liquidity within the Kaia Dapp and drive tangible value creation. During each Epoch, you can complete various missions and accumulate points. Once the Epoch ends, token rewards are distributed based on the total points earned."
  },
  {
    "question": "When does the current Epoch start and end?",
    "answer": "The current Epoch (Epoch#2) runs from February 27 to May 28. Epochs are designed to follow a recurring three-month cycle, meaning future Epochs may continue based on the program’s schedule."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are Tickets and Points?",
    "answer": "During an Epoch, you can earn two key assets: Ecosystem Tickets and Ecosystem Points. \n\n- Ecosystem Tickets are earned daily by completing on-chain missions. \n- Ecosystem Points are automatically accumulated when you provide liquidity to designated pools.\n\nEach Ticket and Point is associated with a specific partner project (e.g., Superwalk Ticket, DragonSwap Point). At the end of an Epoch, your accumulated Tickets and Points determine your share of Kaia Tokens and Ecosystem Token rewards."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I earn Tickets and Points?",
    "answer": "You can earn Ecosystem Tickets and Ecosystem Points in the following ways: \n\n- Ecosystem Tickets: Earned by completing daily on-chain missions. You must claim them manually after completing the required tasks. \n- Ecosystem Points: Earned automatically by providing liquidity to designated pools. Points accumulate hourly but stop when liquidity is removed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do Tickets and Points expire?",
    "answer": "All Tickets and Points accumulated during an Epoch will be automatically converted into Kaia Tokens and Ecosystem Tokens at the end of the Epoch. However you must claim your token rewards separately. Tickets and Points do not carry over to the next Epoch."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a minimum amount required to start earning?",
    "answer": "Yes. To start earning Tickets and Points, you must meet the following minimum requirements: \n\n- Ecosystem Tickets: You must stake at least $10 worth of the required Ecosystem Token as specified in the Daily Mission. \n- Ecosystem Points: You must provide at least $1 in liquidity to a designated pool to start accumulating Points."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there a limit to how many Tickets or Points I can earn per day?",
    "answer": "- Ecosystem Tickets: You can claim one Ticket per Daily Mission each day. \n- Ecosystem Points: There is no limit on how many Points you can earn. Points accumulate automatically based on the amount of liquidity you provide."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I acquire Kaia tokens or other ecosystem tokens to participate?",
    "answer": "You can acquire Kaia Tokens and other Ecosystem Tokens through the following methods: \n\n- Buy KAIA Token: Purchase KAIA Tokens with fiat using Alchemy Pay onn the Portal’s Buy menu. \n- Centralized Exchanges (CEX): Trade on platforms like Binance, OKX, and Bithumb. \n- Decentralized Exchanges (DEX): Swap tokens on Kaia ecosystem DEXs such as DragonSwap and Capybara. \n- Bridging from Other Chains: Transfer assets from external chains to the Kaia chain via the Bridge tab on the portal. Both Stargate and Wormhole bridges are supported. \n\nCheck which assets are supported by the liquidity pool before providing liquidity. Even for the same token (e.g. USDC), USDC sent via Stargate and USDC sent via Wormhole are treated as different assets on Kaia’s DeFi ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are token rewards calculated?",
    "answer": "At the end of Epoch#2, rewards are distributed based on accumulated Ecosystem Tickets and Ecosystem Points. A total of up to 5M KAIA tokens and additional Ecosystem Token Rewards from participating projects will be allocated. \n\nDaily Mission Rewards \n- Ecosystem Token Rewards \n- Distributed proportionally based on the number of Tickets collected. \n- Distributed proportionally based on the number of Tickets collected \n\nLiquidity Mission Rewards \n- Base Rewards: 2.5M KAIA + Ecosystem Token Rewards \n- Unlockable Rewards: \n   Unlocked at 25B Total Points → +1.5M KAIA + $0.4M Ecosystem Tokens \n   First Unlock Based on Total Point → +1.5M KAIA + Ecosystem Token Rewards \n   Second Unlock Based on Total Point → +1M KAIA + Ecosystem Token Rewards \n\nLiquidity rewards are distributed in proportion to Ecosystem Points. Some KAIA and Ecosystem Tokens are also allocated based on total accumulated Points."
  },
  {
    "question": "How and when are rewards distributed?",
    "answer": "All token rewards will be distributed after the Epoch ends, following the announced distribution schedule. \n\n- Rewards will be distributed once per month over a three-month period. \n- Participants must manually claim their rewards through the designated Claim Page. \n\nThe exact distribution timeline will be announced after the Epoch concludes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can I claim my rewards?",
    "answer": "You can claim your token rewards on the Kaia Portal under the Mission → Claim tab. Rewards must be claimed within the designated period."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long do I have to claim my rewards? What happens if I forget?",
    "answer": "You must claim your rewards within the designated period after the Epoch ends. \n\n- The exact claim deadline will be announced after the Epoch ends. \n- Unclaimed rewards may expire if not claimed within the specified timeframe. \n- Expired rewards cannot be recovered once the claim period has passed. \n\nTo avoid losing your rewards, make sure to claim them on time through the Kaia Portal → Mission → Claim tab."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do Boosts work? Can they be stacked?",
    "answer": "There are two types of Boosts in Epoch#2: \n\n- Epoch#1 LP Boost: For accounts that accumulated Portal Points in Epoch#1. Grants a 1.1x multiplier on Ecosystem Points. \n- Early Access Boost: For users who pre-registered during the Early Access period. Grants a 1.05x multiplier on Ecosystem Points. \n\nBoosts cannot be stacked. If eligible for both, only the higher Boost will apply."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should I do if my Points are not accumulating correctly?",
    "answer": "Point accumulation may take some time. Please check the accumulation history again after at least an hour. If there is still an issue, please contact us at portal@kaia.io."
